## ðŸ“… June 2025 â€” Foundation Phase

### âœ… June 8, 2025 â€” Math Mode Enhancement
- Refined the `math_processing` mode with both `simple` and `advanced` capabilities.
- Added support for:
  - Arithmetic operations (e.g., `2 + 2`)
  - Algebraic equations
  - Quadratic solutions
  - Calculus operations (differentiation, integration, limits)

### âœ… June 10, 2025 â€” Multi-Disciplinary Subject Mode
- Integrated `math_processing` with a new `subject_mode` system.
- Subject mode includes WolframAlpha-powered support for:
  - Biology
  - Chemistry
  - Physics
  - History
  - Programming

### âœ… June 12, 2025 â€” Modular Architecture Refactor
- Separated all major mode functions into dedicated `.py` files.
- Significantly improved code maintainability and future scalability.

### âœ… June 13, 2025 â€” Voice Input Integration
- Voice command system implemented using `SpeechRecognition` and fallback CLI.
- AI Companion can now:
  - Accept verbal questions and commands.
  - Respond in real time using voice + WolframAlpha API integration.
- Fully tested and operational via CLI and microphone input.
