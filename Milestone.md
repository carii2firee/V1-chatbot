ðŸš€ AI Companion â€” Development Milestones
A running log of major development achievements, breakthroughs, and features added to the AI Companion project.

ðŸ“… June 2025 â€” Foundation Phase
âœ… June 8, 2025 â€” Math Mode Enhancement
Refined the math_processing mode with both simple and advanced capabilities.

Added support for:

Arithmetic operations (e.g., 2 + 2)

Algebraic equations

Quadratic solutions

Calculus operations (differentiation, integration, limits)

âœ… June 10, 2025 â€” Multi-Disciplinary Subject Mode
Integrated math_processing with a new subject_mode system.

Subject mode includes WolframAlpha-powered support for:

Biology

Chemistry

Physics

History

Programming

âœ… June 12, 2025 â€” Modular Architecture Refactor
Separated all major mode functions into dedicated .py files.

Significantly improved code maintainability and future scalability.

âœ… June 13, 2025 â€” Voice Input Integration
Voice command system implemented using SpeechRecognition and fallback CLI.

AI Companion can now:

Accept verbal questions and commands

Respond in real time using voice + WolframAlpha API integration

Fully tested and operational via CLI and microphone input.

ðŸ§¾ Personal Milestone Log
Real-time progress updates with timestamps â€” no filter, just growth.

June 8, 2025 â€“ 5:14 PM
Successfully refined math processing mode to take in simple and advanced options and carry out tasks such as addition to basic algebra, to quadratic equations and differentiation.

June 10, 2025 â€“ 8:07 PM
Successfully integrated my math mode which consists of simple and advanced math studying with the subject mode which include biology, chemistry, programming, etc.

June 12, 2025 â€“ 11:45 AM
Successfully separated all the modes within my main.py into their own separate files to allow for better file maintainability down the road.

June 13, 2025 â€“ 3:00 PM
Proud to say I have just initiated the voice input instructions for my AI companion which connects to the voice recognition system and it works fully with API integration throughout every AI companion mode.

June 15, 2025 â€“ 9:06 PM
Finished refined task reminder segment with built-in reminder settings to remind the user whatever they set the AI companion to remind them in the set time duration, also give it to them via AI companionâ€™s voice through output.mp3.

June 16, 2025 â€“ 1:55 PM
Successfully implemented mic button within my GUI assistant + casual chat function which allows the user to speak to the voice assistant instead of just type.

June 17, 2025
Language Mode Refinement Complete. Replaced Hugging Face API with Eleven Labs (voice output) + Google Translate API (text), creating a fast, reliable, and seamless language translation mode, now fully voice-responsive and user-friendly.
