# 🤖 AI Companion - V1 Chatbot

Welcome to my first full-stack AI companion project — a modular system designed to support users emotionally, academically, and functionally throughout their day. This is a **work-in-progress**, and I welcome any feedback or constructive criticism as I continue to develop it.
